### CPSC 120

* Lab 10

    Lab 7, part 2 was my favorite as we developed a program corresponding California counties to their population. Working with modular components, the program was able to methodically sort masses of numerical data using a 2D vector. It liked it as it enhanced the personal intent of efficient coding for real-life situations.

* Lab 09
    
    Lab 9, Part 2 was another favorite I encountered. We developed a program that tests a theoretical that two philosophers must look to avoid colliding schedules. I liked how engaging it was, learning how to manipulate C++ strings. It demonstrated the importance of true organization taking on this widespread programming challenge.

* Lab 06
    
    Lab 6, Part 1 was my final favorite of the labs. We programmed a Mad-Libs sandwich ordering program, allowing users to fill in the blanks with toppings of choice. The program was a fun idea as we took command-line arguments to print the user's sandwich order of any imaginable choice! We learned how to initialize variables efficiently, making user prompting and validating input a smooth process.
